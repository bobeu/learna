# Farcaster Mini Apps (formerly Frames) Quickstart by Neynar ü™ê

A Farcaster Mini Apps quickstart npx script.

This is a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) + TypeScript + React app.

## Guide

Check out [this Neynar docs page](https://docs.neynar.com/docs/create-farcaster-miniapp-in-60s) for a simple guide on how to create a Farcaster Mini App in less than 60 seconds!

## Getting Started

To create a new mini app project, run:
```{bash}
npx @neynar/create-farcaster-mini-app@latest
```

To run the project:
```{bash}
cd <PROJECT_NAME>
npm run dev
```

### Importing the CLI
To invoke the CLI directly in JavaScript, add the npm package to your project and use the following import statement:
```{javascript}
import { init } from '@neynar/create-farcaster-mini-app';
```

## Deploying to Vercel
For projects that have made minimal changes to the quickstart template, deploy to vercel by running:
```{bash}
npm run deploy:vercel
```

## Building for Production

To create a production build, run:
```{bash}
npm run build
```

The above command will generate a `.env` file based on the `.env.local` file and user input. Be sure to configure those environment variables on your hosting platform.

## Developing Script Locally

This section is only for working on the script and template. If you simply want to create a mini app and _use_ the template, this section is not for you.

### Recommended: Using `npm link` for Local Development

To iterate on the CLI and test changes in a generated app without publishing to npm:

1. In your installer/template repo (this repo), run:
   ```bash
   npm link
   ```
   This makes your local version globally available as a symlinked package.


1. Now, when you run:
   ```bash
   npx @neynar/create-farcaster-mini-app
   ```
   ...it will use your local changes (including any edits to `init.js` or other files) instead of the published npm version.

### Alternative: Running the Script Directly

You can also run the script directly for quick iteration:

```bash
node ./bin/index.js
```

However, this does not fully replicate the npx install flow and may not catch all issues that would occur in a real user environment.

### Environment Variables and Scripts

If you update environment variable handling, remember to replicate any changes in the `dev`, `build`, and `deploy` scripts as needed. The `build` and `deploy` scripts may need further updates and are less critical for most development workflows.

<!-- "I want to create a set of quizzes on the following subjects: Web3Js, Wagmi, ReactJs, Javascript, Typescript, Hardhat, Farcaster SDK, Python, Rust, Defi, Celo, self-protocol sdk, NextJS, and cryptocurrency. Each subject should be a parent category in a JSON object. Under each category, create three difficulty levels, such as easy, medium, and hard. Each difficulty level should contain at least 10 uniquely crafted questions with a single correct answer. Each question should contain the following fields: question, options, answer, userAnswer, and a hash. The option should be an array of objects. Each object should contain 'label' and 'value'. Use alphabets to denote the label, while the value should be the actual option to the question. The 'answer' field should be the correct answer to the question. 'userAnswer' should have no value, and the hash is a unique hexadecimal value gotten by hashing the question text. Take this prompt and add to the result as a parent category using the key as 'prompt'. Add a 'categories' category as a parent category with the value being all the subjects separated by a comma. Add all the difficulty levels to a parent category called 'difficultylevels' separated by a comma. Note that the format should be grouped by category as specified.", -->
