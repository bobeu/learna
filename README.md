# Educaster

A quiz-based platform that rewards developers for learning and participating in the web3 network.

# Problems
Consistent learning has become a paramount and an essential key to success in any field most especially in the technology space. The system and method of learning play a crucial role in the journey of many. Due to fast-changing technologies, it's hard to keep abreast of information, and reading long-worded, near-endless materials and their enormous existence is becoming tough for every developer who needs to consistently update their knowledge base.

# Solution
With the advent of artificial intelligence, learning has become easier. Our solution leverages AI to provide intuitive, simple, fun, and rewarding methods of learning for developers looking to update their knowledge base such as Quizzes. Our idea was birthed from the Farcaster quiz hackathon to build a Farcaster-based mini-app on the Celo Blockchain that uses AI to generate engaging quizzes with different difficulty levels including other personalized learning method we will introduce in the future.

# Mission
Our mission is to create a fun, engaging, and rewarding learning path for every web3 and web2 developers looking to transition into the web3 world.

# How it works

# Architecture (How we build it)

Educaster is a mobile-first react-based application built for the web3 and web2 audiences with higher preference for the former. By design, it is in three sections:

- A smart contract, deployed on the Celo main network that manages sensitive and the financial logic side.

- A user interface for interacting with the application.
- Backends that manage interactions with the Farcaster client such as publishing casts, notifyinf the users etc.
