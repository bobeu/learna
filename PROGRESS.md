**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Version**: 3.2.0  
**Last Updated**: December 19, 2024, 3:45 PM UTC

#### Summary of Work Done

- **Profile Page Enhancement**: Added campaign creation form with toggle functionality
- **Transaction Handling**: Enhanced success/error handling for campaign creation
- **Error Management**: Comprehensive error handling for all blockchain transactions
- **UI/UX Improvements**: Better form validation and user feedback

#### Files Modified (3 files)

#### Files Created (0 files)
- No new files created in this session

#### Problem Statements & Solutions

**Problem 1**: Users had to navigate to a separate page to create campaigns, creating a disconnected experience.
- **Root Cause**: Campaign creation was isolated on `/campaigns/new` page
- **Solution**: Updated Hero button to navigate to profile page with `?action=create` parameter

**Problem 2**: Profile page lacked campaign creation functionality and proper form management.
- **Root Cause**: Profile page only displayed user campaigns without creation capabilities
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive campaign creation form with toggle, validation, and transaction handling

**Problem 3**: Poor error handling for blockchain transactions led to unclear user feedback.
- **Root Cause**: Generic error messages without specific guidance for different failure types
